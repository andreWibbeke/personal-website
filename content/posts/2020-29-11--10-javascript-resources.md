When learning to code, you’ll come across many different resources, some better than others. It can be overwhelming at times to make the right choice, especially if you just started. While an essential part of your code journey is to search for content yourself, I’d like to share my top ten resources with you that may ease the feeling of being lost at the beginning.

I prefer resources that give you the chance to **get your hands dirty early on**. I genuinely think it’s the best way to retain what you’ve learned.

You can’t do anything wrong by picking any of the items listed below. Try two or three to find out which resonates best with you, and **then stick to it**.

Learning to code on your own can be challenging, especially if you get stuck on a problem. While the basics are relatively easy to pick up, it takes some time to become proficient enough to write meaningful scripts or even applications. Try to reserve some time **each day**, give the concepts a chance to sink in, and [make writing code a habit](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

## FreeCodeCamp (beginner-friendly, free)

[FreeCodeCamp ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)is one of the best resources for learning web development, both client- and server-side. They provide you with short coding exercises as well as more holistic projects for you to complete. The community is open and very active. That is a huge asset, as you will always find someone who has gone through the same struggle. Along with JavaScript, they have sections about HTML and CSS too. Best of all, FCC is entirely free.

## Codecademy (beginner-friendly, paid)

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) was one of the first interactive tools I used to learn to code. Essentially, it’s the same as freeCodeCamp but paid. Codecademy offers a broader scope of programming languages. I haven’t used it for a long time but heard that the content is still excellent and affordable. It feels a little more guided than freeCodeCamp. Yet, it's valuable to learn early on how to figure out things on your own.

## Treehouse (beginner-friendly, paid)

[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) is another popular platform, pretty similar to Codecademy. I haven’t used it myself but heard many good things about it over the years. Let me know what you think in the comments.

## Head First JavaScript Programming: A Brain-Friendly Guide (beginner-friendly, paid)

[Head First JavaScript Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly-dp-144934013X/dp/144934013X/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) is the only book I’m mentioning here. I enjoyed reading almost every page. It is well written, follows a structured approach, and provides plenty of exercises to practice. Worth a look!

## Execute Program (intermediate, paid)

[Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) is one of my favorite places for retaining knowledge that’s easy to forget. They offer bite-sized interactive modules that you are reviewing periodically, leveraging [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). You get a lot of high-quality content and room for practicing for a reasonable amount of money.

## Codewars (intermediate, free)

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is renowned for solving relatively short coding problems (also referred to as “katas”). After you solved a task, you can compare your solution to other people’s answers and what the community has agreed on as a best practice.

## Exercism (intermediate, free)

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is similar to Codewars, but instead of just comparing your solution against some automated testing suite or look at how other people dealt with the task, a real human being is looking over your code and provides helpful feedback.

## Udacity Nanodegree (beginner-friendly, partly free)

The [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) offered a great experience. I certainly learned a lot. However, I wouldn’t thoroughly recommend it anymore due to the steep pricing. You can get a similar learning experience for a fraction of the cost. Apart from its Nanodegree, Udacity offers some free courses, which might be worth a try.

## Apps Script Blastoff (beginner-friendly, free)

Unfortunately, I haven’t taken this [course](https://courses.benlcollins.com/p/apps-script-blastoff) myself, but it might be perfect for you if you’re just starting out. Some friends recommended this course to me a while back.

Using [Goggle Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) as a runtime environment, you don’t have to worry about anything but JavaScript (no HTML, no CSS, no tooling). Google provides you with a text editor right in your browser, and the code runs safely on Google’s Cloud infrastructure. It enables you to automate some simple tasks like fetching and transforming data without worrying about so much other stuff you’d typically have to keep in mind.

Most people start their journey by jumping headfirst into Front-End Development (like I did). However, I’d argue that as a Marketer, you don’t need a deep dive in most Front-End topics to write some helpful scripts or be able to implement marketing tags.

## Video tutorials (beginner-friendly, partly free)

Videos are usually less engaging (e.g., [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/javascript/) (paid) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript) (free)), but some of them are pretty good nonetheless. I encourage you to code along and challenge yourself to try out what you’ve just learned. **Pro tip**: try to come up with a solution yourself before viewing how the author did it. It’s challenging but helps you progress tremendously. **Heads up**: in case you caught yourself just binging video after video, do yourself a favor and pick one of the other resources on my list. If you want to get in shape, you have to work out yourself and not just watch others do it. ;)

Lastly, two resources help me almost every day: the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN) and [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/). They also offer written tutorials, but I use them more frequently to look things up.

That’s it, folks. I hope you enjoyed the article. Thanks for reading!
