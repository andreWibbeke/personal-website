##HI, I'M ANDRÉ.

I’ve been working in the digital marketing space since January 2018, first as a SEA specialist, then transitioned to an Activation Manager position in Programmatic Advertising. I was responsible for planning and managing Programmatic campaigns for well-known brands in the health care sector.

Since I’ve been always more interested in the technology side of the business I’ve started working as Product Implementation Manager in the Digital Technology Department of [Dentsu Aegis Network Germany](https://www.dentsuaegisnetwork.com/de/de) in April 2019.

In a nutshell, our department oversees and maintains the infrastructure that powers the digital advertising ecosystem. Most of our efforts are focused on Programmatic Advertising but not exclusively.

We cover a myriad of topics: from advanced AI projects to advising internal and external stakeholders, resolving data and tracking challenges, troubleshooting technical issues, supporting the development of new products, or just testing some new piece of technology to asses
it’s capabilities.

Feel free to find out more about my role on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9-wibbeke-aa76a4138/). Don’t hesitate to get in touch or send me an invitation to connect.

##Aren’t there like a thousand marketing blogs already out there?

Yes, there are, but very few take a holistic approach over the whole MadTech ecosystem, explaining how its individual parts fit together.

Last but not least, I find most articles rather shallow. They don't dig deep enough to uncover what’s going on behind the curtain.

##What else is there to know about you?

To get a better grasp of how digital marketing technologies work it’s helpful to have a good understanding of the web and get acquainted with its primary technologies, namely HTML, CCS, and JavaScript.

This is one of the reasons I decided to spend some of my spare time working on my web development skills. For instance, I build this website using modern front-end technologies, like [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [GatesbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I’m also hosting a [bi-weekly Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/hack-and-talk-meetup-duesseldorf/) in Düsseldorf for people who are interested in learning about web development with JavaScript. It not only helps to understand things better but enables you to be creative and build a great many things.
